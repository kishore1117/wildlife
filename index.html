                <p>ASIAN ELEPHANT (ELEPHAS MAXIMUS BENGALENSIS)
                    Elephants play a pivotal role in shaping their habitat and directly influence forest composition and density, disperse seeds, and alter the broader landscape. In tropical forests, elephants create clearings and gaps in the canopy that encourage tree regeneration. In the savannas, they reduce bush cover to create an environment favorable to a mix of browsing and grazing animals.</p>

            <h3>Go behind the scenes to view Tanzania’s controversial ivory stockpile.</h3>
            <p>
                In 2012, investigative journalist Aidan Hartley was granted unprecedented access to what is considered the largest known cache of raw ivory in the world. Hartley’s report is part of the National Geographic film Battle for the Elephants, which explores the brutal slaughter of African elephants for their tusks.
                
                In this clip from the film, Hartley meets with Khamis Kagasheki, minister of natural resources for Tanzania, who agreed to allow Hartley and a camera crew to take the first-ever footage of the stockpile. The vast warehouse stores thousands of tusks accumulated over the last 23 years—90 metric tons valued at $50 million. You will follow Hartley into the “ivory room”—a grim memorial to the dramatic decline of Africa’s elephant population.
                
                In July 1989, Kenya issued a call-to-action to alert the world to a poaching crisis. Then President Daniel arap Moi, together with then Executive Director of Kenya Wildlife Service Dr. Richard Leakey, burned 12 tons of ivory stock.</p>
